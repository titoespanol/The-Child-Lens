# The Child Lens

> A platform for systemic change in children's health. We build ventures from scratch, walk hand-in-hand with startups, and shift the perspectives of those in power — all to unearth the deep roots of systems that fail children's health.

## Mission

Children's Health. Further. Faster. Forward.

The Child Lens is a platform for systemic change in children's health. We don't just treat the symptoms. We dig deep into the tangled roots — where funding gaps, power dynamics and cultural blind spots quietly shape outcomes.

Real impact in children's health takes more than a brilliant idea. It takes The Builder, The Right Hand, and The Voice.

## Vision: From Parts to Pattern

When systems speak, change travels. You can advance a therapy, change a policy, or raise a fund. If the parts don't speak, change doesn't travel.

The Child Lens works across the seams, turning isolated efforts into a shared path so progress moves further, faster, together. This is the lens we bring. And it lives through 3 ways of working.

## Method: From Science to Systems

### The Builder

We sit next to you and turn your science into a paediatric venture, step by step. Together, we define the value proposition, map risks — clinical, regulatory, and science-related — check your IP position, and agree on go/no-go criteria that feel fair and doable. We help you shape endpoints that matter to children and clinicians, design with ethics and privacy, and outline a realistic path to first-in-child data. We craft the essentials — one-pager, deck, pilot brief, budget, and a clear, fundable story. We open doors to investors, hospitals and partners — while you keep the steering wheel.

### The Right Hand

We act as your right hand in paediatric innovation, sitting beside your team to make the path clear and doable. With deep experience across biotech, medtech and digital health — from boardrooms to hands-on execution — we bring clarity on what matters next, focus on the few moves that truly move the needle, and momentum to keep things moving. We don't just advise from afar — we roll up our sleeves and help make progress real.

### The Voice

We work to make children's health impossible to ignore. With clarity and courage, we engage directly with policymakers, hospital leaders, funders and other system actors to shift how decisions are made and whose needs are prioritised. We speak the language of science, but also of policy, equity and long-term impact. Because transforming children's health requires more than great ventures — it demands structural change, bold voices, and a collective willingness to rethink the rules.

## Team

We're not just a team — we're co-pilots, sparring partners, and system shifters.
