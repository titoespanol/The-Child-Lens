# The Child Lens

> A platform for systemic change in children's health, based in Barcelona. We build ventures from scratch, walk hand-in-hand with startups, and shift the perspectives of those in power.

The Child Lens works across the seams of children's health — where funding gaps, power dynamics and cultural blind spots quietly shape outcomes. We turn isolated efforts into a shared path so progress moves further, faster, together.

## Three Ways of Working

- **The Builder**: We turn your science into a paediatric venture, step by step — from value proposition to fundable story.
- **The Right Hand**: We act as your right hand in paediatric innovation, bringing clarity, focus, and momentum.
- **The Voice**: We engage directly with policymakers, hospital leaders, and funders to shift how decisions are made.
